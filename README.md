# PyHEP.dev 2023 preparation

Now that there's less than a month before the [PyHEP.dev](https://indico.cern.ch/e/PyHEP2023.dev) workshop, let's organize ourselves into groups to determine who we're going to get in touch with and what we're going to work on.

**Step 1:** Look at the [list of topical groups](https://github.com/jpivarski/PyHEP.dev/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A2023+label%3Atopical-group) and pick the ones you're most interested in. Add a comment to introduce yourself, your background, what you work on, and what you hope to achieve at the workshop.

**Step 2:** As conversations develop, it may seem natural to split a group into more manageable topics or add a new topical group that we didn't think of. Feel free to do that.

**Step 3:** These conversations should lead to kick-off talks. _Everyone_ should [submit an abstract](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1234156/abstracts/) and prepare a PDF presentation for one of the [morning sessions](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1234156/timetable/#20230725.detailed). Include the topical group(s) the talk addresses and estimated time (5, 10, or 15 minutes) in the abstract. (Everyone should give a talk, even if only a 5 minute talk to introduce yourself and what you're interested in.)

**Step 4:** At the workshop, mornings are dedicated to kick-off talks and the afternoonds are free-form. The best way to use this workshop is to gather with the people you interacted with in the topical groups and get something done, whether that's detailed roadmap planning, designing new interfaces between libraries, coding sprints, brainstorming new ideas, getting integrated into a project/onboarding new members, transitioning a project into a new phase based on others' experience, writing documentation or tutorials, etc.

Remember, this is _your_ workshop, your chance to be in the same room with developers of many Python packages in HEP. It will be as useful as you make it!

-----------------

The organization of this workshop is following that of the [Scientific Python Developer Summit](https://github.com/scientific-python/summit-2023), but with kick-off talks.
